## Room for Improvement
Since the task for this project was to just create a replica of a provided screenshot,
the given task was completed successfully.

One area of improvement (while keeping the given tasks in mind):
- For the "Forgot Password" link I used CSS to change the color of the text.
Instead, I could have used an a tag in the HTML to create the same result, 
which would have been a better option, as this would have created a clickable 
link.
